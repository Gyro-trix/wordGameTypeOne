# Word Race: 3 Letter Animal

## This projects goal is to create the described word game using HTML, CSS, and Java Script

The main objective of this game is to have the player type out three letter words and compare it to a themed list. In this case animals.
Score is acquired in three ways. 
First by the word itself weighted based on how common it is (subjective). 
Second by completing quickly and gaining a score bonus depending how much time is left.
Third is having score taken away when an incorrect word is used or when the backspace is used.

## Control Layout

At the top of the page there is an information button that displays a small tutorial

Next to the information button is a quick restart button, resets game back to starting state.

A play/pause button that stops the timer and disables input from the player.

A next level button that only becomes usable after meating a certain criteria.

A virtual keyboard (letters, backspace and enter) at the bottom of the screen to type out words with the mouse
