# wordGameTypeOne (Working Title)

## This projects goal is to create the described word game using HTML, CSS, and Java Script

The main objective of this games to to create as many words as possible using each letter on the keyboard exactly once for different word lengths. 
Levels are determined by word length starting at three letter words then going to four letter words for a second level in this project.
A minimum amount of completed words is required before proceeding to the next level, the player may choose to stay and earn more points or go to the next level. 
Each level also has a timer that can cause the game to end early.

## Control Layout

At the top of the page there is an information button that displays a small tutorial

Next to the information button is a quick restart button, resets game back to starting state.

A play/pause button that stops the timer and disables input from the player.

A next level button that only becomes usable after meating a certain criteria.

A virtual keyboard (containing just letters) at the bottom of the screen to type out words with the mouse
